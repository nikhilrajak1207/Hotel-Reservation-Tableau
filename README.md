# Hotel-Reservation-Tableau

This Tableau project provides an in-depth analysis of hotel reservations, focusing on cancellations, booking trends, and strategies for improving customer retention and reducing cancellation rates.

# Key Insights
Total Bookings and Cancellations:

Total Bookings: 36,275
Cancelled Bookings: 11,885 (32.7% cancellation rate)

# Cancellation Trends:

The majority of cancellations occurred between July to October, accounting for 52.33% of total cancellations. Addressing this seasonal trend with attractive offers could help reduce cancellations significantly during these months.
Online Booking Segment:

71.3% of cancellations originated from online bookings. By improving the online booking experience, hotels can convert more bookings and reduce cancellations. Even a 25% success rate in reducing cancellations can lower the overall cancellation rate from 32.7% to 15.23%.
Customer Retention:

Only 2.5% of bookings are from repeat customers. By enhancing customer experience and offering incentives for repeat visits, the number of repeat bookings can be increased.
Price Sensitivity:

Cancellation rates vary significantly with price: For rooms priced between $70 to $115, the cancellation rate ranges from 10% to 91%. Rooms priced below $75 show a drastically reduced cancellation rate, indicating the importance of pricing strategies.
Room Type Impact:

93.75% of cancellations are for Room Type 1 and Room Type 4. By improving the facilities and services of these room types, and targeting a 20% reduction in cancellations for each, overall cancellations could be reduced by 18.75%.
